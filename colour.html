    <h2>Introduction to Colour</h2>
    <p1>Understanding how clothing colors interact is key to enhancing your style. Colors can complement, contrast, or harmonize with each other, influencing your overall look. Complementary colors, placed opposite on the color wheel, create striking contrasts. Contrasting colors, located next to each other, add energy. Analogous colors, adjacent on the wheel, create harmony. By experimenting with color combinations, you can create outfits that reflect your personal style. Everyone is different and the key is to find a balance that works for you.It should be noted that the tone of a color can drastically change how it interacts with other colors, and knowing how to pair clothing items is a skill that will come with practice. That being said, here are some examples of timeless color combinations</p1>
