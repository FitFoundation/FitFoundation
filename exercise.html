    <h2>Introduction to Exercise</h2>
    <p1>Before beginning the pursuit of a physique it is important to have realistic expectations as well as understanding that results only come with consistency. It is also important to understand the effect these exercises have on you which allows you to properly formulate a plan based on your goals. There are many different types of strength and many different looks that correlate to them as form is often an inaccurate indicator of ability. Everyone is different and the key is to find a balance that works for you. As a general rule, if you want to develop denser muscle, lower your reps and raise the weight. If you want larger muscles with more endurance, raise the reps and lower the weight. But for a general well-rounded physique built out of lean muscle with a great balance of form and function, these are the best exercises.</p1>

<p1><em>Weight should be heavy enough for you to fail at around 10 reps on the first set, then go till failure for the next 4 sets.</em></p1>
<p></p>
<h3>Bench Press:</h3>
<p1>Lie on a flat bench, grip the bar slightly wider than shoulder-width, lower it to your chest, and push it back up while keeping your back flat and feet planted firmly on the ground. Ensure proper form by maintaining a stable shoulder position and engaging your chest muscles throughout the movement.</p1>
<p></p>
<h3>Bicep Curls:</h3>
<p1>Stand with feet shoulder-width apart, hold dumbbells with palms facing forward, curl the weights toward your shoulders while keeping your elbows stationary, and slowly lower them back down. Focus on maintaining proper posture, avoiding excessive swinging or using momentum, and fully contracting the bicep muscles with each repetition.</p1>
<p></p>
<h3>Rows with a Braced Chest:</h3>
<p1>Position yourself on an incline with your chest braced against a bench, grasp dumbbells with palms facing in, pull the weights toward your lower chest by retracting your shoulder blades, and return to the starting position. Remember to maintain a neutral spine and avoid excessive upper body movement.</p1>
<p></p>
<h3>Tricep Cable Extensions:</h3>
<p1>Stand facing away from the cable machine, hold the cable attachment with an overhand grip, extend your arms straight down while keeping your elbows stationary, and then return to the starting position. Focus on keeping your upper arms close to your body, fully extending your arms without locking the elbows, and maintaining tension on the triceps throughout the exercise.</p1>
<p></p>
<h3>Lateral Raises:</h3>
<p1>Stand with feet hip-width apart, hold dumbbells at your sides with palms facing inward, raise your arms out to the sides until they are parallel to the ground, and slowly lower them back down. Keep a slight bend in your elbows, avoid swinging the weights, and engage the lateral deltoids for effective shoulder isolation.</p1>
<p></p>
<h3>Incline Sit-ups:</h3>
<p1>Lie on an incline bench with your feet secured, cross your arms over your chest, contract your abdominal muscles, and lift your upper body towards your knees. Maintain a controlled movement, avoid straining your neck, and engage your core throughout the exercise.</p1>
<p></p>
<h3>Romanian Deadlifts:</h3>
<p1>Stand with feet shoulder-width apart, grasp a barbell or dumbbells with an overhand grip, hinge forward at the hips while maintaining a slight bend in your knees, lower the weight toward the ground, and return to the starting position by squeezing your glutes and engaging your hamstrings. Focus on maintaining a neutral spine, keeping the weight close to your body, and avoiding rounding of the back.</p1>
<p></p>
<h3>Leg Press:</h3>
<p1>Sit on a leg press machine with your back against the pad, place your feet shoulder-width apart on the platform, press the weight away by extending your legs, and then slowly lower it back down. Maintain proper foot placement, avoid locking your knees, and engage your quadriceps and glute muscles throughout the movement.</p1>
<p></p>
<h3>Squats:</h3>
<p1>Stand with feet slightly wider than shoulder-width apart, toes pointing slightly outward, lower your body by bending your knees and pushing your hips back, and then push through your heels to return to a standing position. Keep your chest lifted, back straight, and knees in line with your toes. Start with lighter weights or bodyweight to ensure proper form.</p1>
<p></p>
<h3>Leg Extensions:</h3>
<p1>Sit on a leg extension machine, adjust the pad to rest comfortably against your shins, extend your legs by straightening your knees, and then slowly lower the weight back down. Maintain control throughout the movement, avoid using momentum, and focus on engaging your quadriceps muscles.</p1>
